# Comparative study of Different Cryptographic Algorithms
For comparative analysis among different cryptographic algorithms four algorithms are
chosen among them first and second algorithms are symmetric algorithms and third and four
algorithms are asymmetric algorithm.
Symmetric algorithms
1. 3DES with 192-bit key
2. AES- with 128-bit key
Asymmetric algorithm
3. RSA with 1024-bit key
4. RSA with 2048-bit key
